          <p>
            My name is Maanas Pimplikar and I am a new graduate from Rutgers University - New Brunswick, 
            with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science.
            <br><br>
            My current interests are Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, Cloud engineering, and Distributed Systems.
            Most of my project experience is related to AI/ML and general software engineering, while most of my 
            professional experience is related to Cloud Engineering.
            <br><br>
            I primarily use Python and Java for all coding done at my internship and for my personal projects,
            and I'm very familiar with a lot of technologies and modules, for both common and niche uses. While my knowledge is mostly geared towards
            AI/ML and cloud infrastructure, I am very motivated to learn new skills and am able to quickly apply them to my current projects.

            and others. I then built my first PC when I was a sophomore in high school, and moved to playing FPS games such as CS:GO, Valorant, Destiny 2,
            and also RPG games such as Elden Ring. My current interest is Tekken 8, which is a nice full-circle moment.

            The community is very open to beginners, and I also love the grading system, as it allows me to tangibly measure my progress and skill level. While many
            climbers say to not let the numbers get to you, I still love that aspect of the sport, and am always excited to try harder courses. I was not able to go
            as consistently as there were many things to do this past semester, but I plan on going consistently now that I have graduated!
